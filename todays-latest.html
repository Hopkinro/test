          <h1>Lamborghini</h1>
          <div class="description">
            Lamborghini has been one of the most pristine car brands out there
            for a long time they have made many many cars of different models
            and makes they have been around for 50-plus years and the fun fact
            they actually started first by making tractors and then became
            rivals with Mr.Enzo the owner of ferrari. Ferruccio did not believe
            in motor racing but he didn't want to lose and he knew he had an
            opportunity to be able to make a very cool car the first Lamborghini
            ever shown at an auto show had no motor in it at the time some cool
            features about these cars is the control system and the suspension
            type is very very special the geometry is almost perfect and that is
            why they are so expensive and are very cherished cars one of the
            most iconic Lamborghinis out there is the diablo produced from 1990
            to 2001 and even tho they have gotten way older they have actually
            gone up in price for what they were sold at Lamborghini then wanted
            to keep going on with there cars they made the Gallardo then the
            Aventador next came the huracan and then the urus. There are
            different levels of their cars like any car and some are very very
            expensive over 1 million

          <h1>BMW</h1>
          <div class="description">
            BMW has been around for many many years and they are known for
            making really nice all-around cars you see all types of bmws small
            ones big ones and in between. They have been known for their luxury
            over the years but more recently have they put a ton of time and
            money and detail into the inside of the BMW to make it feel like a
            space ship they used to not do this they were very basic on the
            inside but as technology advanced they were able to advance but this
            obviously comes with an added cost of a few thousand to multiple
            thousands these are nowhere near the price of the Lamborghinis but
            they can sure get up there in price, especially the m series cars.
            BMW stands for Bavarian Motor Company i never knew this until i
            started looking more and more into BMW for this project and I think
            that is very cool. BMW has been ahead of the electric game for
            decades they made the first electric car in 1972. Bmw almost had a
            Lamborghini called the M1 but due to some problems, it never saw the
            light of day. Mercedes Benz attempted to take over BMW at one point
            because they were rivals but it was unsuccessful Bmw was also once
            involved in the sport that we all have heard of this year called F1.
